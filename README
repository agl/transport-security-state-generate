This script is now [part of `hstspreload`](https://github.com/chromium/hstspreload/blob/master/cmd/transport_security_state_static_generate/transport_security_state_static_generate.go).

It will hopefully be incorporated into the Chromium build process some day.  
See [crbug.com/595493](https://crbug.com/595493) for progress.
